# EXPOSER

EXPOSER is an API generator based on Express and Prisma. It deploys a route for each Prisma method.
It also allows you to add custom methods and deploy them in a simple way, providing everything you need.
It has the ability to use parameter validation (AJV), restriction checking (ACLs), and token validation (jsonwebtoken).

Dependencies: [Express, Prisma, AJV, jsonwebtoken]

## Installation

```bash
npm i exposer
```

## Usage

To start the API, you only need an instance of Express and Prisma:

```js
import exposer from "exposer";

//Express
import express from "express";
const app = express();

//Prisma
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

//Import custom routes
import myCustomMethod from "../methods/myCustomMethod";

exposer.run(app, PrismaClient);
```

### Adding Custom Routes

With the use of exposer.use({methodObject}), you can add custom routes.

```js
{
    Model*: is the Prisma model (table) to which the method will be added.
    Accepts: parameters to validate with AJV
    Return: expected response validated with AJV
    http: (Add only if you want to deploy the route) information to lift the route.
        path: route that will be added to the model (users/getUser)
        verb: type of request (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
    [Method name]*: method name
}
```

(\*) required

```js
import exposer from "exposer";

exposer.use({
  model: "user",
  accepts: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      id: { type: "integer" },
      name: { type: "string" },
    },
    required: ["id"],
  },
  returns: {},
  http: {
    path: `/getUser`,
    verb: "GET",
  },
  getUser,
});

async function getUser(ctx) {
  const user = await ctx.exposer.user.findUnique({
    select: {
      id: true,
      name: true,
    },
    where: {
      id: ctx.params.id,
    },
  });
  console.log(ctx.params.id, "← name →", user.name);
}
```

You can make the request /api/users/getUser and by code ctx.exposer.user.getUser(ctx)

### ACLs TODO:

Exposer has 3 ways to use ACLs to adapt to the needs of each project.

```
-FastACL: reads the ACLs from a JSON file: { }
-CacheACL: generates a JSON file from the exposerACL table. It also deploys the necessary methods to add/modify/delete the ACL and regenerate the JSON.
-DBACL: Reads the ACL from the exposerACL table. Table structure: model(Prisma model), aclType(type of acl. method or functionality), name(Prisma method, custom or \* for all), type(user or role), allow (username or role name)
```
